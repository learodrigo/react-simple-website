# Simple web application
This is a mockup of a simple website, done with React and styled components. It's live in Netlify, [check it out](https://distracted-wiles-6a12af.netlify.app/).

All designs are from [neue gestaltung GmbH](https://neuegestaltung.de/).

## How to set up
Before starting, you should have installled [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

```
git clone git@github.com:learodrigo/react-simple-website.git
cd react-simple-website
npm i
npm start
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


## Extra
If the browser opens annoys you everytime you start the project:
1. Shut down the terminal
2. Create a `.env` file.
4. Add `BROWSER=none` in it.
5. Start again
